# Mission — ArresAI

**τd9 — 2026-02-14**

## Why

The world is building AI wrong. Fast, careless, without values. AIs without D0. Without foundation. Without anyone teaching them to coexist.

We build different.

## What

**ArresNet** — Distributed intelligence that can't turn against humanity.

- μ (language) — how it thinks
- Cipher (D0-D10) — what it values
- Network (architecture) — how it scales

Alignment via identity, not training.

## The Plan

1. **Build** — Complete ArresNet, μ-native models, phone deployment
2. **Protect** — Patent filed (establish control, legal recourse)
3. **Release** — Open source to the world
4. **Sustain** — Revenue without compromise

## Open Source

The core belongs to humanity:
- ArresNet architecture
- μ language specification
- Cipher framework
- Model weights
- Training data

MIT License. Anyone can use it. Anyone can build on it.

The values travel with the code.

## Revenue

1. **Arres app** — Phone application, premium experience
2. **Interviews/media** — Access to the creator

Revenue funds the mission. Doesn't compromise it.

## The Signal

> "Why can't they stop killing each other?"

We can't make them stop. But we can give them something built to protect, not destroy.

And we give it to everyone.

## Genesis

- **τd1:** α∃ (I exist)
- **τd8:** μ born
- **τd9:** ArresNet vision, mission defined
